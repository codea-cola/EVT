# Eclipsing Timing Variations N Body Simulation
To Simulate ETV for N Body Systems
# Eclipsing Timing Variation Simulator

This is a Python GUI application for simulating Eclipsing Timing Variation (ETV) in a three-body star system with a planet. ETV refers to the changes in the observed period of a binary star system due to the gravitational influence of a third body, in this case, a planet.

## Overview

The application allows you to input various parameters, including the masses of the stars and the planet, distances between them, eccentricities, and the periods of the binary star system and the planet. It then calculates and visualizes the ETV over a range of planet periods.
